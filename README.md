# Make a Postcard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Images are from Unsplash.com. Upon selecting a country an image is presented in the postcard. The image is the first item received from Unsplash based on the country search criteria, which is typically representative of the country but may not be. A few countries do not have any search data which may result in a blank image.
